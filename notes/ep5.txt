What Is mock Data and Live Data?
What is props dealing?

React Hooks : - A: In React version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern called Hooks. React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks:

- useState: To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it. Re render the component.

When use the common data people can say like -> utils.js, config.js, constant.js, common.js

Two types of import/export
- Default import Export 
    - export default Component;
    - Import Component from “path”
- Named import/export
    - export const Component; // used when the file is exporting multiple things
    - Import {Component} from “path”;

Important Note :- Your file should not more than exists 100 line , if it is , you do wrong something (Uber)

React Js Fast:- Updating DOM manipulation fast (Virtual DOM ) & UI layer and Data sync with each other


Reconciliation algorithm (React fiber) :- 
- The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed
- https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture

Virtual DOM :- It is a representation of actual DOM (HTML Elems), It is a Js object of react element and component

Diff Algorithm :- Tries to find out difference between from old virtual DOM and new virtual DOM (7 elements  -> clicked -> 4 elements)
