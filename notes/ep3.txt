- NPM Scripts (start, build) in package.json
- What is babel ? (http://babeljs.io)
 JSX
    - JSX is merged js and html and gives output as HTML
    - JSX is not HTML , it isHTML-like or XML-like  syntax
    - JSX is HTML have inside have Javascript
    - JSX only understands Ecmascript (Es6)
    - JSX (transpiled before it reaches the JS Engine)
        - Transpiled means convert js code to brewers’s understand code (Like HTML)
        - Parcel is doing transpiled to the JSX code 
            - Not really parcel but it is doing by babel
    - Code :- <h1>Hello World Form JSX 🚀</h1>
    - JSX => Babel transpiles it to React.createElement => ReactElement- Js Object => HTMLElement(render)
    - React Element :- React.createElement => ReactElement- Js Object => HTMLElement(render)
        - React.createElement(‘h1’, {}, ”Hello world From React Js”)
    - Babel is converting JSX code to React create element (HTML Render)
    - Attributes names are must be in camelCase (className)
    - Homework - Cross Site Scripting attacks

React Component 
 -> Class Base Component - OLD
 -> Functional Component - NEW
-> React Component just is a normal JavaScript function that returns a React element (JSX).
-> Name must start with a capital letter.
-> Component Composition - Combine multiple components to create a new component.
